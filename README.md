This repository contains suplementary files to our JMIV paper: 
"On the convergence and sampling of randomized primal-dual algorithms and their application to parallel MRI reconstruction"
by Eric B Gutierrez, Claire Delplancke, and Matthias J Ehrhardt.
https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12291

It contains the necessary scripts and data to recreate the figures listed in the paper. Each script produces a type of figure. Paramaters can be changed in order to produce alternative figures.
